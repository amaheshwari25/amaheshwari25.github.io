I am currently a senior studying computer science and math at Princeton University, where I'm lucky to be advised by Matt Weinberg. 

My research interests are broadly in theoretical computer science, with a focus on <b> algorithm design <b> under incentives, uncertainty, and other interesting models. My main research experience has been in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, where I've been working on matroid prophet inequalities and approximately optimal auction mechanisms. I've also done some work in algorithmic graph theory and quantum computing before that, under the wonderful mentorship of István Miklós (Rényi Institute) and Ali Javadi-Abhari (IBM Research). While at Princeton, I've been grateful to have received the Goldwater Scholarship, Freshman First Honor Prize, and Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence. 

You can reach me at my-first-name@princeton.edu!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
