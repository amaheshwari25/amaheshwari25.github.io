I am a senior studying CS and math at Princeton University, where I'm very lucky to be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). 

My research interests are broadly in <b>theoretical computer science</b>, with a focus on algorithm design under incentives, uncertainty, and other interesting models. 

My main research experience has been in [algorithmic game theory & mechanism design](research.md/#project-matroids), where I've been working on matroid prophet inequalities and approximately optimal auction mechanisms. Previously, I've also done some work in [algorithmic graph theory](research.md/#project-graphs) with István Miklós (Rényi Institute of Mathematics) and [quantum computing](research.md/#project-qc) with Ali Javadi-Abhari (IBM Research). 

I'm grateful to have received the <b>Goldwater Scholarship</b>, Freshman First Honor Prize, and Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence while at Princeton. 

Here's my [CV](../assets/pdf/CV_AryaMaheshwari.pdf). You can reach me at arya (at) princeton (dot) edu!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
