Hi! I recently graduated from Princeton CS in May 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by <b>[Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/)</B>. I’m currently a MSCS student at CMU, where I’m lucky to be working with <b>[Elaine Shi](https://elaineshi.com/)</b>. 

<b> Research: </b> My research interests are broadly in <b>theoretical computer science</b>. I’ve enjoyed working on algorithmic mechanism design and algorithms under uncertainty (with Matt Weinberg) and am currently working on oblivious algorithms (with Elaine Shi). See [here](research) for more about the research I've worked on. 

<b> Funding: </b>  I’m a <b>NSF GRFP</b> recipient, currently on Reserve status (i.e. have full fellowship funding remaining, for use in ‘26-‘27 onwards).

I’m also grateful to have received the Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize in Computer Science (awarded to the [top student](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-graduates) in the CS department at Princeton) and the Goldwater Scholarship as an undergraduate. 

In my free time, I’m usually playing badminton, running late to dance practice, or convincing my friends to play foosball with me. I very much enjoy talking to people, about research or otherwise — please reach out!

Hi! I am a senior studying CS and math at Princeton University, where I'm very lucky to be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). 

My research interests are broadly in <b>theoretical computer science</b>, with a focus on algorithm design under uncertainty, incentives, and other interesting models. 

My main research experience has been in [algorithms under uncertainty and algorithmic mechanism design](research/#project-matroids), where I've worked on matroid prophet inequalities and sample complexity in mechanism design. I've also done some work in [algorithmic graph theory](research/#project-graphs) with István Miklós (Rényi Institute of Mathematics) and [quantum computing](research/#project-qc) with Ali Javadi-Abhari (IBM Research). 

I'm grateful to have received the <b>NSF GRFP</b>, <b>Goldwater Scholarship</b>, Freshman First Honor Prize, Phi Beta Kappa, and Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence while at Princeton. 

In my free time, I'm usually playing badminton or running late to dance practice. You can reach me at arya at princeton dot edu! -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
